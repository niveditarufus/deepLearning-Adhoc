    "New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.\n",
    "Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.\n",
    "New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was subsequently renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.\n",
    "Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. A record 62.8 million tourists visited New York City in 2017. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City that Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial center and the most financially powerful city in the world, and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.\n",

Gray=\\n=20\\nDavis on Monday released a long-awaited financial plan that shows the state=\\n=20\\nwill spend more than $18 billion on electricity through June 2002, but can=\\n=20\\nmaneuver the energy crisis without additional rate increases or draining th=\\ne=20\\nstate budget.=20\\nHis projections, however, were immediately attacked by lawmakers and indust=\\nry=20\\nexperts, who called them overly optimistic and unrealistic.=20\\nThe plan, which Davis is using to bolster his energy effort with legislator=\\ns=20\\nand Wall Street, is based on a series of assumptions, among them that the=\\n=20\\nstate will pay significantly less for electricity on the spot market during=\\n=20\\nthe hottest summer months than it pays now, and that dozens of shuttered=20\\nsmall generators will start selling discount electricity again.=20\\n\"No one has a crystal ball into the future,\" state Treasurer Phil Angelides=\\n=20\\ntold reporters. \"The administration\\'s plan makes some assumptions, as any=\\n=20\\nplan must. The question is, are they reasonable assumptions, and what do we=\\n=20\\nneed to do collectively to make the plan succeed?\"=20\\nThe Democratic governor has long faced criticism for refusing to divulge=20\\ndetails about the state\\'s power purchases, both on the expensive spot marke=\\nt=20\\nand under long-term contracts.=20\\nLast week, the issue was thrust into the forefront when Assembly Republican=\\ns=20\\ntold the governor they would not vote for a bill authorizing the sale of $1=\\n0=20\\nbillion in revenue bonds to pay for the state\\'s power purchases until they=\\n=20\\nreceived additional information.=20\\nIf legislators don\\'t pass the bill -- which requires a two-thirds majority=\\n=20\\nand, therefore, Republican votes -- Angelides said the state might miss a M=\\nay=20\\n8 deadline for closing on a crucial $4.1 billion bridge loan.=20\\nOn Monday, Davis relented, releasing his response in the form of an=20\\ninch-thick document filled with tables, bar graphs and projections. The pla=\\nn=20\\ngives the first detailed, month-by-month account of the state Department of=\\n=20\\nWater Resources\\' expected power purchases through 2002.=20\\nBut the projections failed to win votes immediately in the Assembly=20\\nRepublican caucus, where Minority Floor Leader Dave Cox said he is not yet=\\n=20\\nready to support the proposed $10 billion in bonds. The caucus will meet=20\\ntoday to decide what to do next, he said.=20\\n\"Many of the assumptions are questionable and there is no answer as to what=\\n=20\\nwill happen if the assumptions prove incorrect,\" said Assemblyman Keith=20\\nRichman, R-Sun Valley. \"I\\'m very concerned.\"=20\\nDavis\\' plan relies on numerous estimates, including likely summer=20\\ntemperatures and annual rainfall, and an assumption that Californians will=\\n=20\\nuse 7 percent less energy this year than they did last year.=20\\nPrivate consultants who helped draft the plan also predicted that most of t=\\nhe=20\\nsmall generators that stopped producing electricity because they hadn\\'t bee=\\nn=20\\npaid for months will resume production at discounted rates. They argued tha=\\nt=20\\ntheir assumptions are conservative and allow for unexpected changes.=20\\n\"There are lots of variables that are not simply assumptions,\" said Joseph=\\n=20\\nFichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City and a=20\\nconsultant to the administration. \"I would say probably 80 percent is what =\\nwe=20\\nknow are facts and 20 percent are expectations.\"=20\\nRepublican lawmakers and others were particularly uncomfortable with the=20\\nadministration\\'s conclusion that the state will spend an average of $195 pe=\\nr=20\\nmegawatt-hour for electricity on the spot market in July, August and=20\\nSeptember, the hottest months of the year when electricity is expected to b=\\ne=20\\nsold at a premium.=20\\nSome have predicted that the costs could go much higher.=20\\n\"There\\'s a reasonable chance this summer that the state will be paying $1=\\n=20\\nbillion per week\" for electricity, Severin Borenstein, head of the Universi=\\nty=20\\nof California Energy Institute, told state regulators last week.=20\\nWith summer prices forecast to be $500 to $700 per megawatt-hour, and the=\\n=20\\nstate Department of Water Resources expected to need more than 200,000=20\\nmegawatt-hours a day, it would be easy to rack up billion-dollar power bill=\\ns,=20\\nhe said in an interview.=20\\nThe state spent $90 million on power on a single day last week, but prices=\\n=20\\ndeclined somewhat afterward, according to the governor\\'s press office.=20\\nDavis\\' Cabinet secretary, Susan Kennedy, defended the estimated summertime=\\n=20\\ncost, saying the state has secured enough long-term contracts to limit its=\\n=20\\nexposure to the most expensive spot market prices.=20\\n\"It\\'s almost impossible to say what\\'s plausible and what isn\\'t,\" said Mike=\\n=20\\nFlorio, an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a Bay Area consumer=20\\ngroup.=20\\nIt makes sense that power costs, overall, would drop as more long-term=20\\ncontracts kick in and the state buys less electricity on the spot market, h=\\ne=20\\nsaid. But many of those contracts are still being negotiated.=20\\n\"What this assumes about contracts that have not been signed is the really=\\n=20\\ninteresting question,\" he said.=20\\nAssemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the Davis administration=\\n=20\\nhasn\\'t been able to provide assurances that if bonds are sold now, more won=\\n\\'t=20\\nbe needed in the future.=20\\n\"Their assumptions are nothing more than educated guesses,\" Strickland said=\\n.=20\\n\"And the educated guess of the Legislature was that we wouldn\\'t be in the=\\n=20\\npower buying business in the first place.\"=20\\nKennedy conceded that the administration\\'s plan has its limits, and won\\'t=\\n=20\\nprevent the state from experiencing rolling blackouts in the coming months =\\nif=20\\nprices get too high or its assumptions are proved wrong.=20\\n\"The bottom line will be we will either need to borrow a little bit more or=\\n=20\\nwe\\'re going to see more blackouts,\" she said.=20\\n\\nThe Bee\\'s Emily Bazar can be reached at (916) 326-5540 or ebazar@sacbee.com=\\n.=20\\nBee staff writers Carrie Peyton and John Hill contributed to this report.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\\n---\\n---------------------------------------------\\nPUC seeks to retain PG&E control=20\\nBy Claire Cooper\\nBee Legal Affairs Writer\\n(Published May 1, 2001)=20\\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Warning that California consumers and the state economy=20\\ncould be in grave danger, the state Public Utilities Commission urged a=20\\nfederal bankruptcy judge Monday not to sever the commission\\'s regulatory=20\\ncontrol of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=20\\nOn April 9, three days after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,=\\n=20\\nPG&E petitioned the Bankruptcy Court to block parts of a recent PUC order.=\\n=20\\nPG&E said the provisions conflicted with bankruptcy rules and interfered wi=\\nth=20\\nits legal right to recover skyrocketing wholesale energy coasts.=20\\nThe provisions at issue -- adopted by the PUC on March 27 along with a 30=\\n=20\\npercent rate increase -- imposed new accounting requirements on the=20\\nutilities, but the consequences were potentially dramatic.

About half the money would repay th=\\ne=20\\nstate\\'s beleaguered general fund, which has been drained for power purchase=\\ns,=20\\nand the rest would ease the impact on ratepayers\\' bills for future power=20\\npurchases.=20\\nAdministration officials insisted it is a realistic scheme based on=20\\nreasonable assumptions -- but legislators of both parties remained skeptica=\\nl=20\\nsince the governor\\'s previous assumptions and projections about the crisis=\\n=20\\nhad proved to be uniformly wrong. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether=\\n=20\\nthe bond issue bill that the administration says is vital will win=20\\nlegislative approval this week -- at least in the size Davis is seeking.

The curre=\\nnt=20\\nfutures market price for California-delivered power in July and August is=\\n=20\\nabout $500 per megawatt-hour, but administration officials insist they have=\\n=20\\ncontracted for much of the summer peak load at lower costs, leaving less=20\\nexposure to the spot market.=20\\nIf it all works as Davis hopes, customers of the three major utilities --=\\n=20\\nabout 70 percent of Californians -- will see a sharp boost in their rates=\\n=20\\nsoon, and that will be enough to finance the $20 billion in power purchase=\\n=20\\ndebts incurred by the utilities and the state so far, plus pay for future=\\n=20\\npurchases.=20\\nThe bonds would pick up the costs not covered by the raised rates in the=20\\nearly years of the scheme, then be paid off later as rates remain high but=\\n=20\\npower costs go down. A sharp decline in power costs later in the decade is=\\n=20\\nanother major assumption in Davis\\' plan, based on still another assumption=\\n=20\\nthat massive generating facilities will be built within a few years.=20\\nThe administration\\'s new set of assumptions replaces suppositions that prov=\\ned=20\\nto be very wrong, such as Davis\\' oft-expressed belief that power rates woul=\\nd=20\\nnot have to be raised.

That\\'s significant becau=\\nse=20\\ndining out is one of the first luxuries people typically eliminate when tim=\\nes=20\\nget rough -- or even appear to be slowing down.=20\\nAt the same time, restaurant owners who say business is good remain anxious=\\n=20\\nabout the relentless energy crisis. They complain about big utility bills=\\n=20\\nthat promise to stay bloated through the summer and about higher operating=\\n=20\\ncosts from vendors now passing along their own inflated energy expenses.=20\\nThat all adds up to pricier menus.=20\\n\"I hoped not to increase prices, but there\\'s no slack when basic utilities=\\n=20\\nare so high now,\" said Barbara Mikacich, owner of Sacramento\\'s Andiamo=20\\nrestaurant, which expects to come out with a new menu in June.=20\\nWith a few exceptions, local bakery cafes, pizza shops, swanky steakhouses=\\n=20\\nand more are about to raise food prices while trying to cut back on energy=\\n=20\\nuse.

Sacramento\\'s long struggle to create its=20\\nmunicipal utility district (SMUD) began in the 1920s. It took two decades o=\\nf=20\\nfighting a resistant PG&E for SMUD to get into the distribution business. I=\\nf=20\\ntoday\\'s laws were in effect back then, Sacramentans might still be fighting=\\n,=20\\nor have given up long ago.=20\\nAmid the pile of energy-related legislation in the capitol is one that seek=\\ns=20\\nto remove these roadblocks to public power. At the heart of SB 23x by Sens.=\\n=20\\nNell Soto of Pomona and John Burton of San Francisco are two valuable=20\\nreforms. If the private utilities don\\'t manage to kill this bill, the futur=\\ne=20\\nwill provide interesting choices for communities that are beginning to asse=\\nss=20\\ntheir energy options.=20\\nThe first reform in SB 23x would be to prevent LAFCOs from blocking electio=\\nns=20\\nto decide whether to create a public power agency. LAFCOs now hold this vet=\\no=20\\npower. This is how residents in and around the city of Davis were prevented=\\n=20\\nlast year from voting on a public power initiative on the ballot. They had=\\n=20\\nthousands of signatures on their initiative petitions. But they didn\\'t have=\\n=20\\nthree votes on LAFCO. SB 23x would give LAFCO an advisory role, so that=20\\nvoters can take their findings into consideration.=20\\nThe second reform would change what happens when a newly formed public powe=\\nr=20\\nagency decides to purchase the local electric distribution lines from PG&E.=\\n A=20\\nlaw passed in the early 1990s gave PG&E considerable leverage in court to=\\n=20\\nchallenge whether it\\'s necessary for the municipal utility to buy its wires=\\n.=20\\nPG&E seeks to substitute its will for that of the voters. SB 23x returns to=\\n=20\\nthe municipal utility the legal presumption that it can take over the lines=\\n,=20\\nleaving the courts to settle on the appropriate price. This is the proper=\\n=20\\nrole of the courts.=20\\nA new municipal utility doesn\\'t necessarily have to buy the lines and get=\\n=20\\ninto the distribution business. It may simply buy power in bulk and pass on=\\n=20\\nthe savings to its citizens. The first step is for communities to assess=20\\ntheir options. Davis residents are once again mulling secession from PG&E, =\\nas=20\\nare activists in Fresno, communities within Orange County and San Francisco=\\n.=20\\nIt\\'s too soon to say whether these seeds of a modern-day public power=20\\nmovement ultimately come to fruition.

But=\\n=20\\nGolden Staters from Gov. Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma=\\n=20\\nresident. He might be the man who saves our future.=20\\nBailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary cap=\\ns=20\\non the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall=20\\n2002, when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might=20\\nreturn to the West\\'s energy market.=20\\nHis rationale is this: To save California\\'s private electricity market, new=\\n=20\\npower plants are desperately needed. But not enough of those plants will be=\\n=20\\nbuilt if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product the=\\ny=20\\nalready are providing.=20\\nCalifornians, though, don\\'t want to promise payment without knowing they wi=\\nll=20\\nbe able to afford the bill. Short-term caps on profits, Bailey believes, ar=\\ne=20\\nthe best way to ease the state\\'s fears, get everybody paid and move on to a=\\n=20\\nsystem that works -- for suppliers and customers.=20\\n\"One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create somethin=\\ng=20\\nthat California can look at and say, \\'So long as prices are determined on=\\n=20\\nthis basis, we\\'re prepared to pay,\\' \" Bailey said in an interview. \"This is=\\n a=20\\nmechanism that lets the state say, \\'We\\'re not signing a blank check.

Bailey=\\n=20\\nis proposing that all power sold from now through summer 2002 be priced at=\\n=20\\nthe cost of producing it, plus a profit of 15 percent. That\\'s more than a=\\n=20\\nregulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek, and=\\n=20\\nfar less than electricity providers have been earning of late.=20\\nCynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has=\\n=20\\nsqueezed all it can from California. The firm reported last week that profi=\\nts=20\\ndoubled in the first quarter of 2001 over a year ago, with pretax income fr=\\nom=20\\nits energy services nearly tripling, to $600 million. Much of the 4,000=20\\nmegawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already=20\\ncommitted in long-term contracts -- so Bailey has relatively little to lose=\\n=20\\nif what remains can only be sold at controlled prices.=20\\nBut here is at least one measure of Bailey\\'s sincerity: His company still i=\\ns=20\\nowed $252 million for electricity it has provided California. And he\\'s not=\\n=20\\ninsisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect=\\n,=20\\nor even as part of the deal.=20\\n\"Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with,\" he said. \"Whether that=\\n=20\\nultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the=20\\nparties, it will sort itself out one way or another. Perhaps if we find=20\\nprices that work going forward, that could be used as a framework.\"=20\\nBailey, an engineer by training, says no one should mistake his proposal fo=\\nr=20\\na lack of confidence in free markets. He still firmly believes that a=20\\nderegulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the=\\n=20\\nWest in the long term. He just wants to make sure there is a long term.=20\\nBailey is watching, and listening, to California. He hears talk of seizing=\\n=20\\npower plants, of turning to a public power system. He describes these ideas=\\n=20\\nas Draconian and says they would not solve the problem.

Anyone can be a leader when=20\\nthere\\'s nothing to do but spend a surplus. But the real test comes when the=\\n=20\\nchips are down.\\nNo one should pin their hopes on politicians. Typically, pols should tend t=\\no=20\\nthe administrative affairs of government and let a free people live free=20\\nlives. But the electricity imbroglio is a government-created mess that=20\\ninitially requires a government solution.\\nAfter all, we\\'re talking about highly regulated utilities. It is a botched=\\n=20\\nstate de-regulation plan - actually a re-regulation plan - that exacerbated=\\n=20\\nthe energy problems. And it has been the state\\'s unwillingness to allow pow=\\ner=20\\ngenerators to build plants that has added to supply shortfalls.\\nThere are two directions to choose: Toward a system owned and operated by t=\\nhe=20\\nstate government, or toward a market-based system that treats electricity=\\n=20\\nlike any other commodity. The price of natural gas, food, clothing and othe=\\nr=20\\nessentials are allowed to rise and fall, according to the marketplace.\\nWhy is electricity so holy?\\nIf prices are allowed to float, and generators are allowed to provide the=\\n=20\\njuice to fill demand, soon enough a competitive market will overtake the=20\\ninitial price jumps and force prices down again. Sen. Tom McClintock,=20\\nR-Thousand Oaks, one of the few rational voices in Sacramento, argues that=\\n=20\\nDavis should have returned the surplus to taxpayers, who would have then ha=\\nd=20\\nthe means to pay for the initial price spikes.\\nInstead, Davis has spent the surplus buying electricity, allowing taxpayers=\\n=20\\nto foot the bill because he refuses to allow customers (Aren\\'t they the sam=\\ne=20\\npeople?) to pay market prices. Adding insult to injury, he refuses to make=\\n=20\\nhis dealings public.\\nFurthermore, Davis could have stabilized the situation last year when leade=\\nrs=20\\nof the state\\'s utilities tried in vain to get his attention about looming=\\n=20\\nproblems and to urge limited price increases and use of long-term contracts=\\n=20\\nto buy power. Instead, Davis and his handpicked political crony who runs th=\\ne=20\\nPublic Utilities Commission did nothing - except let a problem spiral into =\\na=20\\nfull-blown crisis.=20\\nWithout any leadership from the top, Californians hear a cacophony of=20\\nproposals from below.\\nThe Legislature, dominated by Democrats far out on the \"left-wing yahoo\"=20\\nscale, are talking about Texas power generators in the same overheated=20\\nrhetoric some right-wingers use to talk about the Chinese communists. One=\\n=20\\ntalked about sending tanks to Houston.\\nUnderstandably, the utility companies are looking out for their own=20\\ninterests.=20\\nPacific Gas & Electric, angry that the governor refused to do anything abou=\\nt=20\\nthe crisis, declared bankruptcy the day after Davis\\' say-nothing address to=\\n=20\\nCalifornians this month. As some commentators note, PG&E is far more=20\\ncomfortable dealing with a bankruptcy judge than dealing with a governor an=\\nd=20\\nlegislators who starred in \"Clueless in Sacramento.\"\\nBy contrast, Southern California Edison has chosen not to file bankruptcy=\\n=20\\nnow, preferring instead to sell the state its transmission lines as a way t=\\no=20\\ngenerate cash to keep this quasi-private entity going.=20\\nJohn Bryson, a longtime Davis associate and a creature of the=20\\ngovernment/regulatory/utility model, frankly admits that the main rationale=\\n=20\\nfor selling the lines to the state is to keep his company afloat, independe=\\nnt=20\\nand credit worthy.\\nBut it\\'s a lousy idea for taxpayers, who would gain a multibillion-dollar=\\n=20\\nliability badly in need of costly maintenance. I don\\'t blame Bryson (who, b=\\ny=20\\nthe way, co-founded the left-wing Natural Resources Defense Council early i=\\nn=20\\nhis career) for looking out for his company first.

Charging whatever California\\'s dysfunctional pow=\\ner=20\\nmarket will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have creat=\\ned=20\\na kind of Kuwait along the Columbia.=20\\nWith their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness o=\\nf=20\\nEastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make stil=\\nl=20\\nmore power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders -- whi=\\nle=20\\nmaking sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North=\\n=20\\nAmerica. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utilit=\\ny=20\\nluxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1.6=\\n=20\\nmillion customers.=20\\nTheir good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may=\\n=20\\nwell be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the=\\n=20\\nregion. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power a=\\nnd=20\\nmay be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall.=20\\n\\'\\'This is not nice money,\\'\\' said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a=\\n=20\\ngroup that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. \\'\\'It is something tha=\\nt=20\\nis offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their=20\\nair-conditioners.\\'\\'=20\\nNice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.=20\\nNorth of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility=\\n=20\\nthat has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year=\\n=20\\nthan it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last=\\n=20\\nyear had a $58.2 million profit.

Hosken, added, \\'\\'We would be=20\\nimprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners.\\'\\'=20\\nNext door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns t=\\nwo=20\\ndams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market.

The utility=\\n=20\\nestimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the=20\\ncoming year.=20\\nLike Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to=\\n=20\\ninsulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as no=\\nw,=20\\nlocal needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant a=\\nnd=20\\nChelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.=20\\nGrant County\\'s utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving=\\n a=20\\nshare of its profits to its customers.=20\\n\\'\\'How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people=\\n=20\\nare paying more for electricity?\\'\\' asked Lon Topaz, director of resource=20\\nmanagement for the utility. \\'\\'It would be lousy politics.\\'\\'=20\\nAn Upside-Down Economy=20\\nThe second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined=\\n=20\\nwith California\\'s deregulation mess to further distort the energy market.=\\n=20\\nDrought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be=\\n=20\\nsold on the spot market -- 10 to 20 times as much as last year\\'s price -- i=\\nt=20\\nhas strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every=\\n=20\\nmegawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in,=20\\nlong-term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sen=\\nt=20\\nsouth to California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings=\\n=20\\nand a long-distance bonanza.=20\\nAs a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower=\\n=20\\nhas been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $4=\\n40=20\\nan acre not to farm.=20\\nSimilarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year b=\\ny=20\\nnot making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight=\\n=20\\nWall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by=20\\nreselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990\\'s under a cheap=20\\nlong-term contract.=20\\nEven residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars=\\n=20\\nfrom the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its=\\n=20\\ncustomers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not us=\\ne,=20\\nif their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year\\'s level.=20\\nFor utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California\\'=\\ns=20\\nelectricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of priva=\\nte=20\\nAmerican utilities have also benefited from California\\'s troubles.=20\\nBC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and=\\n=20\\nPeace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to=20\\nexceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 millio=\\nn=20\\nin United States currency).=20\\nTo celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it=\\n=20\\nhad never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for=\\n=20\\n$130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, whic=\\nh=20\\nhave not gone up for seven years.=20\\n\\'\\'We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were=\\n=20\\nbuilt by people of great foresight,\\'\\' said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of B=\\nC=20\\nHydro.=20\\nWhen reminded that a March study by the California Independent System=20\\nOperator, which runs that state\\'s power grid, accused BC Hydro of market=20\\nmanipulation and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy.=20\\n\\'\\'All they do is scream and shout and they won\\'t pay you the money they owe=\\n=20\\nyou,\\'\\' he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help=20\\nCalifornia in its hour of need.

The river possessed a thi=\\nrd=20\\nof America\\'s hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in t=\\nhe=20\\nNorthwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high-voltage=\\n=20\\ntransmission lines did not exist.=20\\nThe main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in=\\n=20\\nthe 1930\\'s, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam i=\\nn=20\\nNorth America and by far the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily=20\\ndesigned as a water-delivery device for farmers.=20\\nSince then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to=20\\nshuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columb=\\nia=20\\nBasin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in=\\n=20\\nfederal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation,=\\n=20\\nwhich built it.=20\\nIn addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia=\\n=20\\nand the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out=\\n=20\\nof the river -- at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currently=20\\nsells for $375 to $400 on the spot market.

The agency calculated that if it could=20\\npersuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water=\\n=20\\nleft in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 millio=\\nn=20\\n(if it had to be purchased at current market prices).=20\\nIn a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville =\\nis=20\\npaying 800 farmers a total of $30 million.

Since farm prices are low this year,=\\n=20\\nthey agreed that it was a good deal.=20\\nStill, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies=\\n=20\\nthat keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the=20\\nprecedent they set when they traded water for cash.=20\\n\\'\\'This has to be a temporary deal,\\'\\' said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms=\\n=20\\n900 acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout.=\\n=20\\n\\'\\'If anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be n=\\no=20\\ntakers.\\'\\'=20\\nSeveral farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t=\\nhe=20\\nlifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were=20\\ninterviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their=\\n=20\\ntable.=20\\n\\'\\'We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full,\\'\\' sai=\\nd=20\\nTricia C.

He said it would=\\n=20\\nrecommend \"a mix of new legislation, some executive action as well as priva=\\nte=20\\ninitiatives\" to bolster energy production.=20\\nBut he made clear that the administration will base its policy on promoting=\\n a=20\\nvigorous expansion of the traditional energy industry and will avoid the=20\\nkinds of austerity measures that marked the country\\'s response to the energ=\\ny=20\\ncrisis in the 1970s.=20\\n\"To speak exclusively of conservation is to duck the tough issues,\" Cheney=\\n=20\\nsaid. \"Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a=20\\nsufficient basis -- all by itself -- for a sound, comprehensive energy=20\\npolicy.\"=20\\nCheney said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power may=20\\nprovide an important part of the country\\'s energy strategy in the years to=\\n=20\\ncome but that it is premature to rely on them now. \"Years down the road,=20\\nalternative fuels may become a great deal more plentiful,\" he said. \"But we=\\n=20\\nare not yet in any position to stake our economy and our own way of life on=\\n=20\\nthat possibility.\"=20\\nBush promised during last year\\'s campaign to develop a muscular national=20\\nenergy strategy, and named Cheney to head the task force less than two week=\\ns=20\\nafter taking office.

Dianne Feinstein recently. As a consequence of this=20\\nescalation, the pressure is mounting on state and federal legislators to=20\\nsolve the California crisis=01*or to find someone else to blame it on. It\\'s=\\n=20\\nincreasingly looking like political suicide to do nothing.\\n\\nInitiatives and insults are flying, and the only consensus in this=20\\npolitically charged debate is that Western states are facing a grim summer,=\\n=20\\nand merchant power companies=01*an easy target=01*are somehow fleecing Cali=\\nfornia.\\n\\nIn this atmosphere, an interesting, albeit fringe, idea was recently posed =\\nin=20\\na report by economist Peter Navarro of the University of California-Irvine=\\n=20\\nand Michael Shames of the San Diego-based consumer group the Utility=20\\nConsumers\\' Action Network (UCAN).\\n\\n\"California should join with Oregon and Washington to create a buyers\\' cart=\\nel=20\\nto offset the market power of the Western generators. This multistate buyer=\\ns\\'=20\\ncartel should offer to pay a reasonable price for power to the sellers\\'=20\\ncartel members=01*but not a penny more,\" said the report.\\n\\nThe report named Mirant, Enron, Dynegy, Reliant and Williams Cos. as member=\\ns=20\\nof a \"sellers\\' cartel.\"\\n\\nWhile the idea may be organizationally untenable, it nevertheless places th=\\ne=20\\nCalifornia situation in an interesting conceptual framework, given the=20\\npoliticization of the crisis. It\\'s certainly an approach many politicians=\\n=20\\nwould rally around if they could figure out a way to use it to reduce OPEC\\'=\\ns=20\\nmarket influence.\\n\\nThe buyers\\' cartel\\nShames, a consumer advocate, gained notoriety as the author of a 1999 paper=\\n=20\\n(posted on UCAN\\'s Web site) that predicted today\\'s energy crisis. He said t=\\nhe=20\\nidea has garnered a positive response, in some circles.\\n\\n\"Surprisingly so,\" Shames said. \"Supportive sentiments have been echoed by=\\n=20\\nthe head of DWR [California Department of Water Resources] and a number of=\\n=20\\neconomists including Paul Krugman in a New York Times op-ed piece.\" Accordi=\\nng=20\\nto Shames, the recent Senate Bill SBX-73 introduced in California embodies=\\n=20\\nthe critical elements of the cartel approach.\\n\\nUCAN proposes the approach only as a backup plan in the event that the=20\\nWestern situation turns catastrophic this summer. \"One could view it as an=\\n=20\\ninsurance policy; it would not need to be used unless the governor\\'s summer=\\n=20\\nstrategy begins to falter. It contains two elements: creation of a hard-nos=\\ned=20\\n\\'buyers\\' cartel\\' and, if necessary, the forced sale of in-state generation=\\n=20\\nplants to the state,\" said the report.\\n\\nEach day, a Western states buyers\\' cooperative would set a price it conside=\\nrs=20\\nfair and reasonable, based on the cost of producing electricity, natural ga=\\ns=20\\nprices or other fuels, and a generous double-digit profit margin in order t=\\no=20\\nensure future investment in the power infrastructure.\\n\\nA power plant operator that wanted to sell electricity in these three Pacif=\\nic=20\\nCoast states would meet the price set by the cooperative. Those who didn\\'t=\\n=20\\nlike the price could shut down their plants and sit out the market for the=\\n=20\\nday, said Shames and Navarro.\\n\\nFor this plan to be effective, the report\\'s authors concede California\\'s=20\\nlegislature would have to pass emergency legislation to modify current law=\\n=20\\nrequiring California\\'s independent system operator to purchase power \"at an=\\ny=20\\nprice\" to keep the lights on.\\n\\n\"This will empower the buyer\\'s cartel to enforce its fair price offer,\" sai=\\nd=20\\nthe report. It would also hold consumers hostage to a battle between cartel=\\ns.\\n\\nBlackouts as leverage\\n\"The formation of a buyers\\' cartel will almost certainly spark retaliatory=\\n=20\\nblackouts as the sellers\\' cartel tests the political will of our legislator=\\ns=20\\nand governor. Indeed, the bold measures proposed here will require politica=\\nl=20\\nfortitude,\" the report asserts.\\n\\nTo respond to this eventuality, instead of random rolling blackouts sweepin=\\ng=20\\nthe state without notice, rotating outages would be planned and telegraphed=\\n=20\\nahead of time. \"That would give predictability to business and residents,=\\n=20\\nwhich is what most people want. It also would tip off the crooks, of course=\\n,=20\\nwho might prey on homes suddenly left without alarms. But the cops,=20\\nforewarned as well, could mobilize ahead of them with extra patrols,\"=20\\nsuggests the report.\\n\\nThe authors believe calling the bluff once or twice would be enough to brin=\\ng=20\\ncosts down to reasonable levels and break the \"seller\" cartel\\'s market grip=\\n.\\n\\nMerchant power companies would have to answer both to stockholders and the=\\n=20\\noutrage of public opinion if plants were intentionally idled during a=20\\nblackout. Blackouts appear to be inevitable this summer due to genuine powe=\\nr=20\\nshortages, but this approach would at least contain the price of available=\\n=20\\npower according to the logic of the report. The authors say that it\\'s \"a pl=\\nan=20\\nthat a free-market economist could love. Buyers pooling their clout to win =\\na=20\\nbetter price. People sacrificing to get what they want. Generators free to=\\n=20\\nparticipate, or not.\"\\n\\nIf the blackouts grew too disruptive, Shames and Navarro said, Gov. Gray=20\\nDavis and his counterparts in Oregon and Washington would have to use=20\\nemergency powers to seize the plants that refuse to play the game. That\\'s=\\n=20\\nwhen things would get ugly.\\n\\nBunker mentality\\nThe Shames and Navarro proposal has, at its core, a presumption of unfair=\\n=20\\npractices by merchant power, something these companies and other economists=\\n=20\\nwould certainly refute. Ironically, this cartel approach could work in favo=\\nr=20\\nof merchant power as well as buyers, demonstrating that blackouts are not=\\n=20\\nlinked to market manipulation.\\n\\nBeyond theory, the idea would be difficult from a practical standpoint yet =\\nit=20\\nillustrates the growing frustration at many levels with the extraordinary=\\n=20\\nWestern power market.
